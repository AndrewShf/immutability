1. Typecasting raw iterator's next() method's return to a local variable and pass it as method invocation argument.
@Readonly cannot be passed to @Mutable parameter(default)
e.g. /home/mier/jsr308/jdepend/src/jdepend/textui/JDepend.java:241

2 cast to Number String got type cast warning: @Readonly to @Immutable
Algebra 655

3. Similar to above, but now used as actual receiver
e.g. /home/mier/jsr308/jdepend/src/jdepend/textui/JDepend.java:192

4. Calling instance method from constructor, and get fbc error
e.g. /home/mier/jsr308/jdepend/src/jdepend/textui/JDepend.java:47

5. Object[] component type used as actual receiver. Invoked method has default @Mutable declared receiver
e.g. ObjectArrayList 477

6. Object[] component type is casted to local variable, and that local variable is used to call the instance method in jkd,
whose declared receiver is declared to be @Mutable
e.g. /home/mier/jsr308/colt/src/cern/colt/matrix/objectalgo/Partitioning.java:127:

7. Typecasting Object method parameter into a subtype, and call instance method on that subtype. Got method invocation error
e.g. /home/mier/jsr308/colt/src/cern/jet/stat/quantile/UnknownDoubleQuantileEstimator.java:159

8. toString() has @Readonly declared receiver. clone() has @ReceiverDependantMutable declared receiver. Any call to instance
method with defaulted @Mutable causes warnings.
e.g. DoubleQuantileEstimator.java:251

9. Too much method invocation noise
e.g. AbstractBin 56 call to size is not allowed

10. clone() method:
e.g. DoubleBuffer 63
illgeal field write, return incompatible, method invocation invalid, argument type incompatible
e.g. CharArrayList.java:113
method invocation invalid, argument type incompatible
sol: allow flexible overriding in mutable and immutble classes

11. override methods from Object class fails because of default @Mutable declared receiver is not super type of @Readonly
e.g. /home/mier/jsr308/colt/src/cern/colt/matrix/linalg/Smp.java:36

12. CFCrash
/home/mier/jsr308/colt/src/cern/colt/matrix/impl/TridiagonalDoubleMatrix2D.java

13.
e.g. ShortArrayList 354  AbstractShortList 160

14. cannot override error because of no raw class
DoubleListAdapter.java:101: error: [override.param.invalid]
RawList(viewpointAdaptMethod() has problem I think)

!!! In inference mode, we shouldn't always generate (@1) @2 @2 <: @1 constraint. We need the downcasting to allow more flexbile operation
on the expression(@2)

mutable doesn't mean always mutating; rdm and immutable are also "readonly" in its scope, but has more specific information

15. @Immutable String cannot be assigned to @Mutable(default) Object
e.g. Converter 281
sol: make Object @Readonly(because String and other mutable objects can both be passed into Object), and enable downcasting.
