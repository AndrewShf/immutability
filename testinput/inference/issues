INF-FR:
1. Don't need bound annotation and the subtype constraint related to it
2. Don't need the var annot on extends(?)
3. Create refinement variable slot for local variable variable tree, too.

AFU:
1. Can't insert solution to constructor return type

Change CFI to add @Target(TypeUse) to jaif files.
Use method return syntax for constructor return.

2. Insertion anomoly for array types on rhs.
